To Do:

- barchart zooming
- connect the zooming with the "create_wordcloud()" function -> from the zooming we need a name, a year and the steps (1, 5 or 10) for the function, so if anything is named or given an ID in the zooming progress: keep in mind that we need to connect it to the wordcloud function (can be found in "wordcloud.js")
- make List and Wordcloud the same height
- for some mysterious reason some words are not "clickable", not quite sure what's going on there üïµÔ∏è‚Äç
- make the title for the wordclouds readable
