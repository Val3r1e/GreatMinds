To Do:

- barchart zooming
- connect the zooming with the "create_wordcloud()" function -> from the zooming we need a name, a year and the steps (1, 5 or 10) for the function, so if anything is named or given an ID in the zooming progress: keep in mind that we need to connect it to the wordcloud function (can be found in "wordcloud.js")
- multiselect won't be possible unless there is any way to highlight the selected words instead of just showing the one selected word (and I just can't find a way -.- But it was not a required function anyway so I guess that's okay ...)
(- make the title for the wordclouds readable -> imporâ€ ant??)
