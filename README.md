To Do:

- barchart zooming
- bring the barchart into the html with the rest
- connect the zooming with the "create_wordcloud()" function -> from the zooming we need a name, a year and the steps (1, 5 or 10) for the function, so if anything is named or given an ID in the zooming progress: keep in mind what we need to connect it to the wordcloud function (can be found in "wordcloud.js")
- click on a word in wordcloud -> list of corresponging letters (somehow we have the get the word and search all the letters for that word)
- make the title for the wordclouds readable
